# K8sTcpDump
If your application is currently NOT equipped with TCP dump utility or other network utilities and you're seeking to execute these tools, like ping, nc, ifconfig, etc., on demand within your Application pod without requiring K8s root user privileges or enabling capabilities on your running app pod, or adding ephemeral storage options in your RBAC, then you're in luck. Here's the solution, deploy a K8sTCPDump pod on the worker node where your application pod resides and then attach this pod to your application pod's network namespace. This enables you to start utilizing TCPdump or other network utilities seamlessly without distrubing your application pod functionaltiy and its state.
